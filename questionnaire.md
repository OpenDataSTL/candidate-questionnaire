We are OpenDataSTL, a local, volunteer brigade of [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/), a non-profit organization of citizens, technologists and public servants working together to address civic and community issues through open data and technology. 

We’re sending local candidates in the November 2014 elections this survey to help voters understand candidates' ideas and approaches on transparency and open data.  Although OpenDataSTL is not formally endosing any specific candidates based on a single questionnaire, we do believe that open access to municipal and county data is a vital issue. It is the tool of government transparency for our time, the foundation of community and civic technology innovation, and an enabler of democratic participation in government processes.

If you are unfamiliar with the issue of Open Data, we invite you to review the included FAQ. If you have any questions, or are interested in meeting with members of the local open data community, feel free to email ------------.

Thank you for your time,

OpenDataSTL Contributors

Please note, your responses will be published by OpenDataSTL and/or shared with media.

1. What is your general view on government open data and promoting the social and economic health of St. Louis?

2. What is your general view on government open data as it relates to government transparency, accountability, and public participation in St. Louis?

3. Based on your experience, does the St. Louis currently provide enough open, standardized, digital data?  What kinds of government information or specific data sets would you like to see made more available to citizens?

4. Many datasets controlled by municipalities/counties are made up exclusively of legally public data. Do you support making such datasets available online for public reuse the default transparency and openness policy for the city within one year of taking office?

    Yes  |  No   (Circle One)

    Comments:

5. Do you support making city/county open data sets available in the most standard, non-proprietary, reusable, and machine readable format possible the default policy?

    Yes  |  No  (Circle One)

    Comments:

6. What process will you uses to determine which city/county controlled datasets should not be shared with the public online in an open standard way (e.g. via a city/county open data online repository)? 

7. Are there specific data sets with only public data that you feel should not be made available to the public in downloadable formats or for direct public use at this time? (Data sets with legally defined private information are by their nature not included. An example of a more sensitive "public" data set is the City of Seattle making near-realtime 911 call data available on a public online map.)

8. If elected, what will your strategy be to implement the city open data policy that you envision and have described in your responses above?

#FAQ

##What is Open Data?
Most often, ‘open data’ refers to the idea that data controlled by a government body should be accessible to citizens and other government bodies in a structured format. The concept of open data can be broken down into three levels:

1. Legal access to data - Citizens have the basic right to access government data

2. Reasonable access to data - Government data can be accessed at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable time frame

3. Access to structured data - Government data can be retrieved in an open format that computer programs can readily understand and process. For example, a CSV is an open, structured format, while a PDF is not.

##What is an Open Standard?
In the context of open data, an open standard typically refers to a data format whose specification is freely available to be read and implemented by anybody. Data available in an open standard is often the most accessible to analysts, journalists, and programmers, as anybody can access the tools and information needed to work with that data. Because of this, open standards often support competitive markets of applications and organizations that perform similar services on similar types of data. 

##Do City reports provide access to city data?
Not to the level that open data does. A report published by the city represents a finished presentation of data. The report includes analysis, formatting and layout, and commentary that is meant to be read by people, and often meant to be read by a certain audience. While these presentations of data are valuable, they usually do not provide the raw, structured data required by others who wish to create their own analyses, presentations, or new applications.

##Which cities officially support open data?
As of September 18, 2014, [all five of the largest US cities have open data policies](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/10/15/all-five-of-the-largest-u-s-cities-now-have-open-data-policies/).
In addition, a report by the [San Diego Data Bank](sandiegodata.org/reports/municipal-open-data-policies/) recently analyzed the policies of 8 major US and Canadian cities that have implemented open data programs in the last seven years. These cities include Austin, Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. At the federal level, the White House has also implemented an open data policy for the executive branch.

##Are there best practices for local governments looking to provide Open Data?
The Sunlight Foundation has created a living set of [open data guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/) to address what data should be public, how to make data public, and how to implement policy, which is a great place to start if you'd like to learn more!
