We are OpenDataSTL, a local, volunteer brigade of [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/), a non-profit organization of citizens, technologists and public servants working together to address civic and community issues through open data and technology. 

Weâ€™re sending local candidates in the November 2014 elections this survey to help voters understand candidates' ideas and approaches on transparency and open data.  Although OpenDataSTL is not formally endosing any specific candidates based on a single questionnaire, we do believe that open access to municipal and county data is a vital issue. It is the tool of government transparency for our time, the foundation of community and civic technology innovation, and an enabler of democratic participation in government processes.

If you are unfamiliar with the issue of Open Data, we invite you to review the included FAQ. If you have any questions, or are interested in meeting with members of the local open data community, feel free to email ------------.

Thank you for your time,
OpenDataSTL Contributors

1. What is your general view on government open data and promoting the social and economic health of St. Louis?

2. What is your general view on government open data as it relates to government transparency, accountability, and public participation in St. Louis?

3. Based on your experience, does the St. Louis currently provide enough open, standardized, digital data?  What kinds of government information or specific data sets would you like to see made more available to citizens?

4. Many datasets controlled by municipalities/counties are made up exclusively of legally public data. Do you support making such datasets available online for public reuse the default transparency and openness policy for the city within one year of taking office?

Comments:

5. Do you support making city/county open data sets available in the most standard, non-proprietary, reusable, and machine readable format possible the default policy?

Yes  |  No  (Circle One)

Comments:

6. What process will you uses to determine which city/county controlled datasets should not be shared with the public online in an open standard way (e.g. via a city/county open data online repository)? 

7. Are there specific data sets with only public data that you feel should not be made available to the public in downloadable formats or for direct public use at this time? (Data sets with legally defined private information are by their nature not included. An example of a more sensitive "public" data set is the City of Seattle making near-realtime 911 call data available on a public online map.)

8. If elected, what will your strategy be to implement the city open data policy that you envision and have described in your responses above?
